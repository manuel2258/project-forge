# forge

Read `docs/vision.md` for what this is, `docs/decisions.md` for what is settled, and
`docs/poc-plan.md` for what is being built and in what order. Design notes for the current
milestone live in `docs/design/`; code follows them, and a change of mind updates the note first.

`docs/design/ui.md` is the standard for every operator surface and `docs/design/capacity.md` for
how consumption is modelled and drawn. Read both before changing anything the operator sees.

## Layout

Three Mix projects joined by path dependencies. Not an umbrella.

- `core/` (`forge_core`): workflow parser, event schema, artifact types. No processes.
- `platform/` (`forge`): Phoenix + LiveView platform. Depends on core. Read `platform/AGENTS.md`
  for Phoenix and LiveView conventions.
- `worker/` (`forge_worker`): standalone release for the worker-side agent manager. Depends on core.

`flake.nix` provides the devshell and builds both releases. Enter with `nix develop` or direnv.

## Quality gate

Run before every commit, from the repository root:

```
bin/check
```

It runs `mix check` in every project: compile with warnings as errors, format check, Credo
strict, tests. A commit that does not pass the gate is not made.

## Landing

Work lands on `main` directly, as one squashed commit per branch, fast-forward only. Use the
`land` skill (`.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`); it rebases, resolves conflicts, squashes and
pushes. No pull requests, no merge commits.

## Rules

- Dependency versions are pinned. Do not loosen constraints to get something to compile.
- Prefer Phoenix generators for boilerplate, then edit the generated code.
- Read the docs of a library from `deps/<name>` before using an API you are not certain of.
- Do not add a dependency without saying why in the commit message.
